participant ":Structure" as struct
participant "CollisionHandler" as ch

note right of ch
	CollisionHandler is a static
	class. That means that it can 
	be reached from anywhere
end note

[-> eh : playerInteract()
activate eh

eh -> player : interctCoord = interact()
activate player
deactivate player

note right
	When the player interacts, the tile
	which is pointed from the direction
	of the player is the interactCoord
end note

loop nrOfStructure
	eh -> struct : structCoord = getCoords()
	activate struct
	deactivate struct

	eh -> ch : isInteract = isCol(structCoord, interactCoord)
	activate ch
	deactivate ch
end

alt isInteract == true
	eh -> struct : effect = getInteractionEffect(structCoord)
	activate struct
	deactivate struct
end

note right 
	The effect in this case is
	that the player will enter a new
	room
end note

deactivate eh

activate eh
[->eh : progressDir = getProgression()
activate eh
deactivate eh

note right
