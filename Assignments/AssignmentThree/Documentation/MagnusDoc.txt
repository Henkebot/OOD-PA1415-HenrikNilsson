I've decided that we need a class wich is called Application. This class is where the game loop is.
Created Application class : public sf::Drawable
	- Added void run() 			//Here are the game loop
	- Added void update(float dt) 		//This updates the stack.peek()
	- Added sf::RenderWindow window		//This is the window the game will be running on
I removed the game loop from the source.cpp
Created IStack.h
	- Added push(), pop(), peek(), set() and isEmpty().

Created Stack.h : public :IStack<T>
	I made the IDS with an array.
	- Added copy-constructor and Assignment operator.

Created test_Stack
	Stack.h passes my tests.

Created State.h & Client.h
	- State & Client some what are holding eachothers hands... So I was forced to create these paralell to eachother,
	- There will only be one Client and all States will have a pointer to that Client.
	- The Client will be deleted in the destructor of application, where it will also be created.
	- I've decided to actually put a protected variable to the Client in the State class so that every state can reach it.

In the Client class I've decided to remove the bool "running". This is because we use SFML and we will use window.isOpen() instead.

I get a compiling problem:
	...\state.h(9): error C2061: syntax error: identifier 'Client'
	...\state.h(20): error C2143: syntax error: missing ';' before '*'
	...\state.h(20): error C4430: missing type specifier - int assumed. Note: C++ does not support default-int
	...\state.h(20): error C2238: unexpected token(s) preceding ';'
